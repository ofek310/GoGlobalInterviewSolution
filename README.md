# GoGlobalInterviewSolution

To initiate the application, follow these steps:
-	Begin by launching the solution file and executing the controller named "GitHubRepositoryController."
-	The HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files are located within the project. To start the project, open the "home.html" file. Here, you can input the necessary search term and proceed to the "GalleryItems.html" page, where a gallery displaying all the search results will be displayed.


Additional Notes:
-	It is assumed that users will input a valid email address in the pop-up window for email submissions.
-	We rely on the assumption that each repository returned from a GitHub request possesses a unique identifier. This assumption is crucial for the fourth section, where all requested repositories are stored in the session within a dictionary. The requested repository is inserted into the dictionary using its unique ID.
